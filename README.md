# Streaming Twitter rock climbing data into an MYSQL database

My first time using Twitter's API to collect data and add to a MYSQL database.
I decided to find words relating to rock climbing as I know there will be less tweets and I can see if the code ran properly.


## Getting Started

Set-up a Twitter account:
```

### Prerequisites

You can use pip to install the following:
